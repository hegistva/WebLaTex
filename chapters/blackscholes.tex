The Black-Scholes formula for pricing a European call option is given by:
\begin{equation}
C = S_0 \Phi(d_1) - K e^{-rT} \Phi(d_2)
\end{equation}

where
\begin{align}
d_1 &= \frac{\ln(S_0 / K) + (r + \sigma^2 / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}} \\
d_2 &= d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}
\end{align}

Here, \(C\) is the call option price, \(S_0\) is the current stock price, \(K\) is the strike price, \(r\) is the risk-free interest rate, \(\sigma\) is the volatility of the stock, \(T\) is the time to maturity, and \(\Phi\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.
